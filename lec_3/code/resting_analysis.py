        2. Notch filtering the mains frequency (50Hz) for Europe.

        Note that since we are particularly interested in analyzing the brain activity inside the alpha (8-13Hz) band, we could have band-pass filtered our recordings using lower value for the upper-frequency of the filter (i.e. 30Hz)

        ### Spectral Analysis

        In this part, we perform the spectral analysis of the signals. 

        1. First we plot the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the signals in both conditions (eyes open/eyes closed) using ```fmin=0Hz``` to ```fmax=48Hz``` for each channel. Finally we plot the **average** PSD using all channels for each condition.
        2. We make a selection of EEG electrodes near the region of interest. Since we are interested for alpha activity which is located at the back of the brain (occipital), we don't want the signal to analyze and plot to be "contaminated" by brain activity not directly related to the eyes open/closed experiment. For this, we consider only the parietal and occipital electrodes and in particular the P3, P4, Pz, O1 and O2 and plot the PSD for each one of these.
        3. Then, we plot the topography of the power as this is distributed on the electrode space (topographic plot) in different basic frequency bands (delta - theta - alpha - beta - gamma). This is very informative, as it can reveal the area that significant PSD is located (we expect this area to be at the back of the head for the eyes closed condition).
        4. Finally we show each channel's PSD relative to its position on the head. This plot is interactive, as we can click on any PSD and have it zoomed in a separate window.
